INTRODUCTION
============

LCQPow extends qpOASES with the recently proposed solution strategy for
Quadratic Programs with Complementarity Constraints. The approach is based on
a standard penalty homotopy reformulated using sequential convex programming.
The convex sequence derives from linearizing the (necessarily) nonconvex
penalty function. This leads to a constant objective Hessian matrix throughout
all iterates, and thus enables us to solve the linear complementarity quadratic
program with a single factorization of the KKT matrix (by using qpOASES).



GETTING STARTED
===============


1. The whole software package can be obtained from
      https://gitlab.syscop.de/jonas.hall/LCQPow

2. We provide a Dockerfile which installing LCQPow and running a first test example.
   For direct installation on your system refer to the steps taken in this Dockerfile.

2. The file LICENSE.txt contains a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
   License (v2.1). Please read it carefully before using LCQPow!
